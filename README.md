## Objective
To secure a 508 Tester/Educator position and iterate over and refine a suite of accessibility tools I generated with OpenAI.

## Summary
I tackle inclusion and adoption of applications very thoroughly and through a multitude of angles. Look forward to any opportunity to talk to my experience and the limitations of opensource and commercial tools, unmotivated teams, or even my limited availability, and how I overcome each.

I intentionally DO NOT write my own code anymore, I only plan, refine and define definition of done.
