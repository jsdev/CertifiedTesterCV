## Relative Work History

- 2023 Stood up a DOM Mutation Auditor that does continuous micro scans as a page mutates from user interactions, enabling teams without e2e tests, or access to manual testers awareness of violations and access to solutions.
- 2022 Presented a lightning talk at the Agile Dev Conf on how to combine any e2e suite, any app router, axe-core's micro test injection, and a usability config to run at scale (up to 212k micro tests and counting). Leveraged git hooks locally to ensure a no-tolerance policy for introducing accessibility bugs without increasing pipeline times. Tests scale automatically as the coverage grows as you build out your routes and application.
- 2021 Selected to set up and lead an organization accessibility reporting and remediation program on a secured network. Successfully led multiple teams to ship fully compliant applications.

Project was supposed to just be a 10-day holdover stop for me while my clearance processed but I built the query builder UI interface my first week and got renewed every 2 weeks until we delivered and engaged other countries. This app is now used all over the world its opensourced and allows people to import any intel data source, hard or loose.
- 2013-2014 Mobile Lead for Veteran Affairs, stood up and seeded 6 mobile teams and delivered 13 mobile apps. All apps I submitted went through the various app stores on first attempt largely as a result of perfect accessibility. Would be promoted to Release Engineer to ensure all other apps made into app stores on first submission.
